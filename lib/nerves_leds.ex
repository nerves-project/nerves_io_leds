defmodule Nerves.Leds do
  @moduledoc """
  A convenient interface to setting LEDs defined in `/sys/class/leds`.

  While an application could write directly to /sys/class/leds, the main advantage
  of using this module is to provide a layer of abstraction that allows easily
  defining application-specific led names and states, like this:

  ```elixir
  alias Nerves.Leds

  Leds.set power: true                            # turn on the led we called "power"
  Leds.set power: :slowblink                      # make it blink slowly
  Leds.set connected: false, alert: :fastblink    # set multiple LED states at once

  ## alternate syntax via set/2

  Leds.set :power, :slowblink

  ```

  ## Configuration

  Use config.exs in your application to create a friendly name that maps to an
  entry in `/sys/class/leds` that make sense for your application.

  A trivial example for Raspberry Pi:

  ```elixir
  # in your app's config/config.exs:
  config :nerves_leds, names: [ red: "led0", green: "led1" ]
  ```

  A more useful example for the Alix 2D boards implementing a router:

  ```elixir
  # in your app's config/config.exs:
  config :nerves_leds, names: [
    power:     "alix:1",
    connected: "alix:2",
    alert:     "alix:3"
  ]
  ```

  ## Included states

  In addition to `true` (on) and `false` (off) the following atoms provide predefined
  behaviors:

  - `:slowblink` - turns on and off slowly (about twice a second)
  - `:fastblink` - turns on and off rapidly (about 7.5 times a second)
  - `:slowwink` - mostly on, but "winks off" once every second or so
  - `:heartbeat` - a heartbeat pattern

  ## Customizing states

  The standard LED states are defined as `@predefined_states` near the top of
  `lib/nerves_leds.ex`. You can change or add to them using config.exs as
  follows:

  ```elixir
  config :nerves_leds, states: [
  	fastblink: [ trigger: "timer", delay_off: 40, delay_on: 30 ],
  	blip: [ trigger: "timer", delay_off: 1000, delay_on: 100 ]]
  ```

  See the Linux documentation on `sys/class/leds` to understand the meaning of
  trigger, delay, brightness, and other settings.
